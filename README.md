Getting Started (Frontend Only)

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/IshwariDeshmukh19/tourism_management.git
cd tourism_management


2. Install dependencies

npm install


3. Run development server

npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).



For a full-stack version, you can create a server/ folder with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT-based auth. Want help with that part?

Next Steps & Enhancements

Set up backend with full CRUD and admin authentication

Integrate MongoDB for persistent data storage

Add user authentication (JWT-based)

Enhance UI with maps and real-time booking calendar

Deploy via Netlify (frontend) and Heroku/Vercel (backend)
